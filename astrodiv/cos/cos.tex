We have obtained three-dimensional maps of the universe 
in $\sim200\times200\times80$ comoving Mpc$^3$ (cMpc$^3$) volumes each at $z=5.7$ and $6.6$ 
based on a spectroscopic sample of 179 galaxies that achieves $\gtrsim80$\% completeness 
down to the Ly$\alpha$ luminosity of $\log(L_{\rm Ly\alpha}/[\mathrm{erg\ s^{-1}}])=43.0$, 
based on our Keck and Gemini observations and the literature 
(Figure \ref{cos:Harikane2019_Fig3}).
The maps reveal filamentary large-scale structures and two remarkable overdensities 
made out of at least 44 and 12 galaxies at $z=5.692$ (z57OD) and $z=6.585$ (z66OD), respectively, 
making z66OD the most distant overdensity spectroscopically confirmed to date, 
with $>10$ spectroscopically confirmed galaxies.
We compare spatial distributions of submillimeter galaxies at $z\simeq 4-6$ 
with our $z=5.7$ galaxies forming the large-scale structures, 
and detect a $99.97\%$ signal of cross-correlation, 
indicative of a clear coincidence of dusty star-forming galaxy and dust-unobscured galaxy formation 
at this early epoch.
The galaxies in z57OD and z66OD are actively forming stars with star-formation rates (SFRs) 
$\gtrsim5$ times higher than the main sequence, 
and particularly the SFR density (SFRD) in z57OD is 10 times higher than the cosmic average 
at the redshift (a.k.a. the Madau-Lilly plot).
Comparisons with numerical simulations suggest that 
z57OD and z66OD are protoclusters that are progenitors of the present-day clusters 
with halo masses of $\sim10^{14} M_\odot$.

Fast Outflows Identified in Early Star-forming Galaxies at $z = 5$--$6$
{\rm \cite{sugahara2019}}
}

\vspace{3pt}

In collaboration with the members of

\vspace{10pt}

We present velocities of galactic outflows in seven star-forming galaxies at $z=5$--$6$ 
with stellar masses of $M_\ast \sim10^{10.1} M_\odot$. 
Although it is challenging to observationally determine the outflow velocities, 
we overcome this by using 
Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)
%ALMA 
[{\sc Cii}]158 $\mu$m emission lines for systemic velocities 
and deep Keck spectra with metal absorption lines for velocity profiles available to date. 
We construct a composite Keck spectrum of the galaxies at $z=5$--$6$ 
with the [{\sc Cii}]-systemic velocities, 
and fit outflow-line profiles to the Si{\sc ii}$\lambda1260$, C{\sc ii}$\lambda1335$, 
and Si{\sc iv}$\lambda\lambda1394,1403$ absorption lines in the composite spectrum. 
We measure the maximum (90\%) and central outflow velocities to be 
$v_{\rm max} = 700^{+180}_{-110}$ km s$^{-1}$ 
and $v_{\rm out} = 400^{+100}_{-150}$ km s$^{-1}$ on average, respectively, 
showing no significant differences between the outflow velocities 
derived with the low- to high-ionization absorption lines. 
For $M_\ast \sim10^{10.1} M_\odot$, 
we find that the $v_{\rm max}$ value of our $z=5$--$6$ galaxies is 3 times higher 
than those of $z\sim0$ galaxies and comparable to $z\sim2$ galaxies. 
Estimating the halo circular velocity $v_{\rm cir}$ from the stellar masses and the abundance matching results, 
we investigate a $v_{\rm max}$--$v_{\rm cir}$ relation (Figure \ref{cos:Sugahara2019_fig3}). 
Interestingly, $v_{\rm max}$ for galaxies with $M_\ast = 10^{10.0-10.8} M_\odot$ shows 
a clear positive correlation with $v_{\rm cir}$ and/or the galaxy star formation rate over $z=0$--$6$ 
with a small scatter of $\simeq \pm 0.1$ dex, 
which is in good agreement with theoretical predictions. 
This positive correlation suggests that the outflow velocity is physically related to the halo circular velocity, 
and that the redshift evolution of $v_{\rm max}$ at fixed $M_\ast$ 
is explained by the increase in $v_{\rm cir}$ toward high redshift.

First Identification of $10$ kpc [{\sc Cii}] $158\mu$m Halos around Star-forming Galaxies at $z = 5$--$7$

We report the discovery of 10 kpc {\sc [Cii]} 158$\mu$m halos 
surrounding star-forming galaxies in the early Universe. 
We choose deep ALMA data of 18 galaxies, 
each with a star-formation rate of $\simeq 10$--$70\,M_\odot$ 
with no signature of 
%AGN
active galactic nucleus (AGN) 
whose {\sc [Cii]} lines are individually detected at $z=5.153$--$7.142$,
and we conduct stacking of the {\sc [Cii]} lines and dust continuum 
in the $uv$-visibility plane. 
The radial profiles of the surface brightnesses show a 10 kpc scale {\sc [Cii]} halo 
at the 9.2$\sigma$ level, significantly more extended than the 
\textit{Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) stellar continuum data
by a factor of $\sim5$ on the exponential-profile basis, as well as the dust continuum 
(Figure \ref{cos:fujimoto2019_fig11}).
We compare the radial profiles of {\sc [Cii]} and Ly$\alpha$ halos
universally found in star-forming galaxies at this epoch, 
and find that the scale lengths agree within $1\sigma$ level.
While two independent hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations match the dust and stellar continuum properties, 
the simulations cannot reproduce the extended {\sc [Cii]} line emission.
The existence of the extended {\sc [Cii]} halo is evidence of outflow remnants in the early galaxies 
and suggests that the outflows may be dominated by cold-mode outflows expelling the neutral gas.

Balmer Break Galaxy Candidates at $z\sim6$: 
A Potential View on the Star Formation Activity at $z \gtrsim 14$

\vspace{10pt}

We search for galaxies with a strong Balmer break (Balmer Break Galaxies; BBGs) 
at $z \sim 6$ over a 0.41\,deg$^2$ effective area in the COSMOS field. 
Based on rich imaging data, including data obtained with the ALMA, 
%Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), 
three candidates are identified by their extremely red $K - [3.6]$ colors, 
as well as by non-detection in X-ray, optical, 
%far-infrared (FIR), 
FIR, 
and radio bands. 
The non-detection in the deep ALMA observations suggests that 
they are not dusty galaxies but BBGs at $z \sim 6$, 
although contamination from 
%active galactic nuclei (AGNs) 
AGNs 
at $z \sim 0$ cannot be completely ruled out for the moment.
Our spectral energy distribution (SED) analyses reveal that 
the BBG candidates at $z \sim 6$ have stellar masses of $\approx 5 \times 10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$ 
dominated by old stellar populations with ages of $\gtrsim 700$ Myr. 
Assuming that all the three candidates are real BBGs at $z \sim 6$, 
we estimate the stellar mass density (SMD) to be $2.4^{+2.3}_{-1.3} \times 10^{4}\,M_{\odot}$\,Mpc$^{-3}$ 
(Figure \ref{cos:Mawatari2020_fig13}). 
This is consistent with an extrapolation from the lower-redshift measurements. 
The onset of star formation in the three BBG candidates is expected to be several hundred million years 
before the observed epoch of $z \sim 6$. 
We estimate the 
%star-formation rate density (SFRD) 
SFRD 
contributed by progenitors of the BBGs 
to be ($2.4$--$12) \times 10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}$\,yr$^{-1}\,$Mpc$^{-3}$ at $z > 14$ (99.7\% confidence range). 
Our result suggests a smooth evolution of the SFRD beyond $z = 8$.

We report the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) discovery of two Ly$\alpha$ blobs (LABs), 
dubbed z70-1 and z49-1 at $z=6.965$ and $z=4.888$ respectively, 
that are Ly$\alpha$ emitters with a bright ($\log L_{\rm Ly\alpha}/{\rm [erg\ s^{-1}]}>43.4$) 
and spatially-extended Ly$\alpha$ emission, 
and present the photometric and spectroscopic properties of a total of seven LABs: 
the two new LABs and five previously known LABs at $z=5.7$--$6.6$. 
The z70-1 LAB shows extended Ly$\alpha$ emission with a scale length of $1.4\pm 0.2$ kpc, 
about three times larger than the UV continuum emission, 
making z70-1 the most distant LAB identified to date. 
All of the seven LABs, except z49-1, exhibit no AGN signatures such as X-ray emission, 
{\sc Nv}$\lambda$1240 emission, or Ly$\alpha$ line broadening, 
while z49-1 has a strong {\sc Civ}$\lambda$1548 emission line 
indicating an AGN on the basis of the UV-line ratio diagnostics. 
We carefully model the point-spread functions of the HSC images 
and conduct two-component exponential profile fitting 
to the extended Ly$\alpha$ emission of the LABs. 
The Ly$\alpha$ scale lengths of the core (star-forming region) 
and halo components are $r_{\rm c}=0.6$--$1.2$ kpc and $r_{\rm h}=2.0$--$13.8$ kpc, respectively. 
The relations between the scale lengths and galaxy properties 
(Ly$\alpha$ luminosity $L_{\rm Ly\alpha}$, Ly$\alpha$ rest-frame equivalent width EW$_0$, 
and UV continuum magnitude $M_{\rm UV}$) of our LABs 
are similar to those of Ly$\alpha$ halos (LAHs) 
identified around star-forming galaxies 
found previously by VLT/MUSE at similar redshifts (Figure \ref{cos:Zhang2020_Fig12}), 
suggesting that our LABs are likely the bright version of high-$z$ LAHs. 
%The average $r_{\rm h}$ of the LABs falls on the extrapolation of the $r_{\rm h}$-Ly$\alpha$ luminosity relation of the Ly$\alpha$ halos around VLT/MUSE star-forming galaxies at the similar redshifts, suggesting that typical LABs at $z\gtrsim5$ are not special objects, but star-forming galaxies at the bright end.
