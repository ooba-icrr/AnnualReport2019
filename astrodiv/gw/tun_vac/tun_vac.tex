We firstly pumped six vacuum chambers those are IFI, IMM, PRM, PR3, PR2, and BS and vacuum pressure achieved order of $10^{-5}$\,Pa. We made control boxes for seven large gate valves those are GVmc between MCF and IFI, GVbsx between BS and IXC, GVitmx between IXA and the X-arm tube, GVetmx between the X-arm and EXA, GVbsy between BS and IYC, GVitmy between IYA and the Y-arm tube, and GVetmy between the Y-arm and EYA. The control boxes has open/close control buttons and indicators. The GVs will be controlled by remotely via KAGRA machine control system which has Programable Logic Circuits through the control boxes.

%The vacuum sub-group of the KAGRA project has been designed and fabricated two vacuum chambers for BRT (Beam Reducing Telescope) in 2016. Both chambers have already placed at the both end experiment rooms. The BRT chamber is made of SUS304 and dimensions are diameter of 1200\,mm, height of 2400\,mm, and weight of 1990\,kg.

%We procured 16 sets of Turbo Molecular Pumps (TMP), 17 sets of root pumps, and 10 sets of ion pumps. Evacuation speed of the TMPs, the root pumps, and the ion pumps are larger than 2000\,L/s for N$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$, 600\,L/s for N$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$, and 800\,L/s for N$_{2}$ and 1200\,L/s for H$_{2}$, respectively. Finally, KAGRA has 17 sets of TMP pumping units consisting of a TMP and a root pump and 10 sets of TMP and ION pumping units consisting of a TMP, a root pump, and an ion pump. We placed 15 sets of the TMP pumping units in the center experiment room, 1 set of the TMP pumping unit in the both end experiment rooms, and 5 sets of the TMP and ION pumping units in the both arm ducts.
